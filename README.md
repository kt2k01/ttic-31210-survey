# Utilizing Phonetic Information for Textual NLP Tasks
A survey paper as the course project of TTIC 31210 Advanced Natural Language Processing. Presentation video available at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hG0Og1s2pvn_ohKcxJUhKrGusFJqXkiU.

Received the top score for both final report (12.5/13) and final presentation (10/10). To address some limits of this project, I continued to practice survey writing in [this blog post](https://kt2k01.github.io/posts/2022/06/logbook/).
